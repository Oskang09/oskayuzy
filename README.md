# Development

With github actions, every night will run a script to get data from instagram, and pump into `gist`. You can see the script at `index.js` and `action.yml` for workflow setting. For frontend it's using `react` & `vitejs` to do development.

# Build

For github actions script have to build with `@vercel/ncc` before push, frontend also have to build before push. Since my github pages is set to `master` branch so it take from `docs/` folder in `master` branch. In `public/` folder having `CNAME` it's for custom domain setting ifn't the original setting will be overrided.

# Make your own

1. Update setting in `assets/setting.json`.
2. Run `yarn build` to build with new setting.
3. Rename title in `index.html` with your preferred title name.
4. Update images with yours in `assets/images/` folder.
5. Update repository name in `.github/workflows/schedule.yml`. 
6. Add `GH_TOKEN` with your github token for updating `gist`.
7. Push to repository.
8. Trigger the actions to fetch data from instagram.
9. Here you go.
